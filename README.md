<!--- introduction --->
## Introduction
Bristol Cyber Solutions (BCS) is a business I considered starting in Summer 2022 after completing the Open University 
course "Introduction to cyber security: stay safe online". I found myself poorly informed about such matters 
and after chatting about it with a friend, a soletrader, I formed the opinion that there could be a 
customer base of domestic users, soletraders and micro-businesses. While there are companies already providing 
cyber services, none of them seemed targeted at small businesses with little money to spend on security issues. 
My main concern was that I was not qualified enough or had not yet built a trustworthy reputation.

The website I have presented is practicable but unlikely to be used commercially as of yet. Frankly, while
domestic and business costs spiral upwards, a start-up service is unlikely to attract enough business in the present
economic climate. This might well change... I registered a domain with the company 34SP.com who are based in 
Manchester as it was important to me to find a company registered in England and whose servers were in England: 
I could then be sure that jurisdictionally I was covered by the Data protection Act 2018. However, while the 
project is published on GitHub, this is not the case. I have used the domain name for server space
so that I can host the images used in this project.

<!--- customers' expectations --->
## Expectations
When a potential customer views the BCS site, they are presented with information to help them decide whether they need this service. Facts and
figures are given aplenty - images are minimal by design - so that BCS gets people thinking. The business is not about curing a machine that
has a virus, but steps to prevent that happening. As I say at the beginning in the quotes section, I was subject to a ransomware attack
and it was very scary: my data life was in a hostile persons' hands. Thankfully I was able to deal with it myself but I guess that those who can't
and/or have very sensitive info would pay up. Cyber Management Alliance gives the figure of US$111,737,688.23 being paid in ransomware demands
in 2022, an extraordinary amount. 

So our customers want to be defended against those threats, they want to be given a sense of security by a business claiming to do so. As a
business, BCS want customers to return if they upgrade their system or like what we do. Users expect an excellent service and hope to get it.

## Features
<!--- homepage --->
### Homepage
This introduces the potential customer to the aims of BCS. It provides an introduction, a hook, some rhetorical questions, 
an image, quotes and a blog preview.
    <ul>
        <li>The introduction is: "BCS exists to help its clients feel more secure about their computer use at the workplace or at home". This introduces the business and what it is about.
        </li> 
        <li>The hook is: "While directed more towards soletraders and micro-businesses, home users can also gain security awareness." Users of the service can feel safer if they use BCS.
        </li> 
        <li>The rhetorical questions are: "Perhaps you don't think that there is much of a threat to you or your business? Maybe you consider a data breach an unlikely event?" These questions ask the customer their attitudes or awareness to gain a reaction - but they don't need any formal answers.
        <li>The 'chained laptop' image suggests a way customers could find some security but, as written, BC has much better solutions! It might
             well produce a smile, something that many sites don't.
        </li>
        <li>The quotes containers (from bootstrap) give background and customer reviews (made up). The containers are lightblue and have
            letters in black and italicized so as to produce a contrast with the main body.
        </li>
        <li>The blog preview gives an example of cyber issues - Royal Mail being attacked in this case - and directs people to the blog
            for more examples.
        </li>
    </ul>

<!--- solutions --->
### Solutions
This gives an explanation of what is available, a phone malware image, phonetips (avoiding phone malware), quotes and links to useful sites.
    <ul>
        <li>The Solutions page gives advice about strategies that can be used, such as password management and encrypted spaces within drives. (This means that only a section of a drive is used - the whole computer is still as usual). 
        </li>
        <li>The image of a phone with the skull and crossbones suggests that phones can be used hacked and used malevolently. People don't
            seem to understand that a mobile, or 'radio', can be listened to easily. The link in the Realities page to the Channel 4 documentary
            expands on this.
        </li>
        <li>The phonetips section gives advice on phone precautions, taken from the Know B4 site (link in contacts). It tries to get people thinking
            about what they can do: simple advice really. 
        </li>
        <li>Finally there are links to three sites, orientated towards business users. Sophos Threatsaurus is something we should all read and
            is free!
        </li>
    </ul>

### Blog
This page shows items of interest about security happenings and some issues that people face.
    <ul>
        <li>The first picture is a combination of two headlines from the Guardian about data breaches. The caption also contains
            info from NASDAQ that 2 billion people were victims of data breaches in 2018, a staggering amount and a dereliction of duty by
            companies. That's your data!
        </li>
        <li>The second picture is made up of four examples of websites and the 3rd-party trackers - organisations that observe your
            online habits. It shows figures for these trackers as exposed by the EFF's Privacy Badger software. Near 2,000 trackers
            are registered on their database with Google and Facebook being the main offenders. (Facebook tracks users who are not on
            it so as to find out their preferences). I've never given them the right to do so as I'm not a Facebook user.
        </li>
        <li>The third picture introduces the concept of ransomware and how a whole country can be attacked. Scary!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div align="center">
        <img src="https://www.bristolcybersolutions.co.uk/uploads/1/4/4/2/144286628/bcs-databreach_orig.jpg" title="data_breaches_twitter_and_facebook" width="350" height="215" alt="data_breaches_twitter_and_facebook">
    </div>

<!--- realities --->
### Realities
This page gives facts and figures about cyber issues and how it is out there in cyberland. It also gives links to sites that demonstrate this.
    <ul>
        <li> The first line says a lot about the state of affairs: "For all of 2021, Trend Micro reports over 94 billion threats, a 42% increase from 2020."
        </li>
        <li>The links again give reminders about the state of malware attacks. The Channel 4 phone documentary is an eye-opener - some
             students are invited to a free lunch, only to find that two people in an adjacent room have been hacking their phones while they ate.
             Statements like so-and-so has been to Romania recently produce amazed looks. A must!
        </li>
        <li>There are links to two live threat sites.
        </li>
        <li>The picture of the Ohio data breach guide is a useful end note.
        </li> 
    </ul>
    <div align="center">

    </div>
<!--- end of realities --->
<!--- contact --->
### Contact
The Contacts page gives address details and provides a contact form for enquiries. It also explains about pricing options 
but warns that security advice is not a purchase that should be taken lightly. Stating that pricing equates to customers' 
status and needs indicates that there are different options for different clients. Contact details for BCS are given, though made up.

<!--- testing --->
## Testing
The website was assembled with HTML 5 and CSS 3 using VS Code Desktop v 1.74.2, Microsoft Edge Tools and Chrome Developers Tools v109. VS Code using MSE tools has a built-in live preview window (v0.5.2023...) which is linked to Chrome Tools and its many phone templates. Having in effect two browser windows on my desktop linked to VSCode, both of which are editable in real time, I felt no pressure to use GitPod until I needed to. Throughout the assembly VS Code was regularly checked for problems and by deployment time none were found. Code Beautify was used to tidy code and helped reveal poorly-executed code. When I felt that the coding was ready, I validated it using the W3.org website as is wanted - the latest validation being on the 30th January 2023. The website was viewed with several android phones, Windows 10 laptops, an iPad and a 24" desktop screen. Also 3 browsers Firefox, Chrome and MS Edge were checked. (MS Edge seemed to handle the colours best). The site was found to be responsive and all links worked, including the image links to the data hosting site.

<!--- deployment section --->
## Deployment
  I started a new repo on the GitHub site 'bristol_cyber_security' and was careful about how it was presented. The site was first deployed on GitHub pages on the 23rd January 2023 and was found to work. Editing was needed on screen width sizes for compatability and general text thining. It also became important to homogenize: there were five pages not one website! Styling across the site helped mitigate this. The process was:
    <ul>
        <li>The repo 'bristol_cyber_security' was started from within GitHub on the 23rd January 2023.
        </li>
        <li>The website 'Bristol Cyber Solutions' was usable at the time when first deployed and was seen by staff at the City of Bristol College who were generally positive.
        </li>
        <li>After deployment, it became clear that although the background vector image was attractive, it was hindrance to actually reading the text
         unless the user scrolled. It looked great but the user experience was negative. This was the background used with the wireframe examples.
        </li>
        <li>That colourful background image was changed within a week for a more 'corporate' type blue vector background with some broad 
          diagonal lines of the same blue colour which my friends and I thought looked good and seemed reasonable.
        </li>
        <li> Yet during a session with my mentor Rory, we looked at the website Lighthouse to guage how it scored, only to find that parts of it scored 95% in accessibility and so had to be improved. There were mainly problems with some gold text and the background pattern.
        </li>
        <li> The present plain  blue background was introduced and the gold text was taken out. This has remained the final colour 
        </li>
        <li> Various icons were added using Font Awesome. Colouring some of these proved to be hard to read so the majority of them became plain again.
        </li>
        <li> After my final session with my mentor on the 31st of January, I submitted the website using the appropriate form on the 1st February.
        </li>
        <li> 7th February started using a lighter blue/grey background. Tested with PageSpeed Insights and was found to be OK on all pages.
    </ul>

## Wireframes
Wireframes were constructed using Balsamiq Cloud. I concentrated on three main sizes: Google Nest Hub Max (1280 x 800), iPad (768 x 1024) and iPhone 6/7/8 (414 x 736), for each of the five pages. During the process of constructing the website from the initial paper drawings, I used many Chrome templates to show any sizing issues while developing the wireframes. It was a process that could be called synergetic rather than in strict order. To finalise the wireframe designs that I had made it seemed reasonable to use the Chrome Tools templates that also had image frames. I have also included images for several other devices using just the homepage: Galaxy S20 Ultra (412 x 915), Moto G4 (360 x 640) and a Nexus 6P (412 x 732). All wireframe images are available <a href="https://github.com/RichardJohnNowell/bristol_cyber_security/tree/main/assets/bcs_images" title="bcs_wireframe_images" target="_blank" alt="bcs_wireframe_images"
