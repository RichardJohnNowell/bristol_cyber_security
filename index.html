        </strong> exists to help its clients feel more secure about their computer use at the workplace or at home. 
            While directed more towards soletraders and micro-businesses, home users can also gain security awareness. 
            Perhaps you don't think that there is much of a threat to you or your business? Maybe you consider a data 
            breach an unlikely event? Some might say that it doesn't worry their business - "We're not likely to be attacked".

          </strong>has more practical solutions than the chained laptop above! On our website, the Solutions page has info, links and phonetips 
          while the Contacts page gives pricings as well. The Blog shows items of interest and finally, the Realities page gives facts and figures. 
          During 2023 while business costs spiral, cybersecurity might not be high on the list of necessary services. Please look at the Realities 
          page before cutting budgets - you might change your mind!

        "I was the victim of a ransomware attack a few years ago. It was scary how hackers
        could just take over my computer and threaten to delete everything unless I paid up. I guess
        like a lot of people, I thought that it only happened to others. Only when I was victimised
        did I realise how poorly informed I was. Now I look after my data and feel better for it." Richard, BCS.
