      <p>Buying security advice is not a purchase that should be taken lightly and it is best that you should dwell on what you actually want. 
        BCS exists for soletraders, micro-businesses and householders who should be aware of what they are asking for and what can be provided. 
        BCS suggests that you use 2-factor authentication for online banking and security key use is encouraged for business.
      </p>  
      <p>Soletraders are especially vunerable as they do not necessarily have a budget for security concerns, yet have crucial information 
        that could be hacked. While most cyber attacks are on large companies, people do have an interest in traders business data, 
        if only to nose around in. Documents can be forged and altered - your most crucial facts and figures can be copied or deleted.
      </p>
      <p>Pricing jobs can be difficult, though you will find BCS charges equate with customers' status and needs. Please contact us describing 
         the nature of your enquiries to find out a list of options available. No guarantee of defence against future malware is given.

      <p>"I am a householder with important legal documents that I am concerned about. 
        I had enquired with a nationwide security company whose prices were eye-watering - just not for me. 
        Then a friend recommended BCS as he had similar financial worries. It turned out that BCS charged a fair rate 
        and were able to work flexibly with me and my busy ife." C.D, Bristol.
