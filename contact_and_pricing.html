BCS exists for soletraders, micro-businesses and householders who should be aware of what they are asking for and what can be provided. Soletraders are especially vunerable as they do not necessarily have a budget for security concerns, yet have crucial information that could be hacked. While most cyber attacks are on large companies, hostiles do have an interest in small trader's business data. Documents can be forged and altered - your most crucial facts and figures can be copied or deleted.</p><br><p><i class="fa fa-exclamation" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;<strong>PRICING</strong> Please contact BCS using the contact box describing the nature of your enquiries to find out a list of options available. No guarantee of defence against future malware is given.</p></div><br><div class="contacts"><ul><li>Bristol Cyber Solutions, Stokes Croft, Bristol.</li></ul></div><br><div class="container"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;"I am a householder with important legal documents that I am concerned about. I had enquired with a nationwide security company whose prices were eye-watering. Then a friend recommended BCS as he had similar financial worries. It turned out that BCS charged a fair rate and were able to work flexibly with me and my busy life."
