      <p>There are few easy solutions to your security needs. Major companies with cybersecurity staff get hacked so what chance do you have against malevolent persons? 
        Being aware of the issues and damage limitation are ways to proceed, but first you need to know how your attackers operate and how common scams begin. 
        Update as much and as often as you can and backup on at least 2 different devices (some recommend 3). Use a password safe and generator - 
        avoid passwords like 'Richard_1' or 'fluffy'. If you can think of it so can someone else - do you know what a 'dictionary attack' is? Make a list of all 
        your data assets noting their importance and only keep what is necessary on your machines.

      <p>"As a soletrader, I had lots of documentation that was unsecured which worried me as it was not a good way to conduct business. 
        BCS helped me with password management and encrypted spaces within my desktop. These are good solutions to my problems 
        that took less than a morning to install. I feel a lot safer now and for a reasonable rate." AB, Bristol.</p>
